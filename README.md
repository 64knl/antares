Antares is an SQL client based on [Electron.js](https://github.com/electron/electron) and [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) that aims to become a useful tool, especially for developers.  
Our target is to support as many databases as possible, and all major operating systems, including the ARM versions.  

**At the moment this application is in development state, many features will come in future updates**, and supports only MySQL/MariaDB and PostgreSQL.  
At the moment, however, there are all the features necessary to have a pleasant database management experience, so give it a chance and send us your feedback, we would really appreciate it.  
We are actively working on it, hoping to provide new cool features, improvements and fixes as soon as possible.  

üîó If you are curious to try Antares you can download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/Fabio286/antares/releases/latest).  
üëÅ To stay tuned for new releases [follow Antares SQL](https://twitter.com/AntaresSQL) on Twitter.

## Philosophy

Why are we developing an SQL client when there are a lot of them on the market?  
The main goal is to develop a totally free, full featured, cross platform and open source alternative, empowered by JavaScript's ecosystem.  
A modern application created with minimalism and semplicity in mind, with features in the right places, not hundreds of tiny buttons, nested tabs or submenu; productivity comes first.  

## Installation

Based on your operating system you can have one or more distribution formats to choose based on your preferences.  
Since Antares SQL is a free software we haven't a budget to spend in annual licenses or certificates. This can result that on some platforms you need some additional passages to install this app.

### Linux

On Linux you can simply download and run `.AppImage` distributions, install from Snap Store or from AUR.

### Windows

On Windows you can choose between Microsoft Store and download `.exe` distribution. The latter lacks of a certificate, so to install you need to click on "More info" and then "Run anyway" on SmartScreen prompt.

### MacOS

On macOS you can run `.dmg` distribution following [this guide](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac) to install apps from unknown developers.
