# Antares SQL Client

![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/estarium/antares) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EStarium/antares.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EStarium/antares) ![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/estarium/antares/total) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/estarium/antares)

Antares is an SQL client based on [Electron.js](https://github.com/electron/electron) and [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) that aims to become a useful tool, especially for developers.  
My target is to support as many databases as possible, and all major operating systems, including the ARM versions.  

**At the moment this application is an alpha, it lacks many features, and isn't ready as a main SQL client**. However i'm actively working on it, hoping to provide all essential features as soon as possible.

üîó If you are curious to try this early state of Antares you can download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/EStarium/antares/releases).  
üëÅ To stay tuned for new releases watch this repo on **Release only** channel.  
üåü Don't forget to **leave a star** if you appreciate this project.

## Philosophy

Why am I developing an SQL client when there are a lot of them on the market?  
The main goal is to develop a totally free, cross platform and open source alternative, empowered by JavaScript's ecosystem.  
An application created with minimalism and semplicity in mind, with features in the right places, not hundreds of tiny buttons or submenu.
