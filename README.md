# Antares SQL Client

![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/estarium/antares) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EStarium/antares.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EStarium/antares) ![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/estarium/antares/total) ![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/estarium/antares)

Antares is an SQL client based on Electron.js and Vue.js that aims to become a useful tool, especially for developers.  
My target is to support as many databases as possible, and all major operating systems, including the ARM versions.  

At the moment this application is in a development state, it lacks many features, and is'nt ready as a main SQL client. However i'm actively working on it, hoping to provide all essential features as soon as possible.

If you are curious to try this early state of Antares you can download and install the [latest release](https://github.com/EStarium/antares/releases), and stay tuned for updates. At moment i'm testing only on Windows.
